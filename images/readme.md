A tight competition between filtering method and spammers is going on per day, as spammers began to use tricky methods to overcome the spam filters like using random sender addresses or append random characters at the beginning or end of mails subject line.

unwanted junk mail and it consumed storage space and communication bandwidth.

Rules in other existing must be constantly updated and maintained make it more burden to some user and it is hard to manually compare the accuracy of classified data.

**5.Purpose / Social Importance of the Project**

Implementing spam filtering is extremely important for any organization and individual. Not only does spam filtering helps to the keep garbage out of email inboxes, it helps with the quality of life of work emails because they run smoothly and are only used for their desired purpose.

Spam filtering is essentially an anti-malware tool, as many attacks through email are trying to trick users to click on a malicious attachment, asking them to supply their credentials, and much more.

Email spam filters, which may be part of a security application or an email system add- on, can catch many spam messages, depositing them in a user's spam folder rather than their inbox. However, it's impossible to completely eliminate spam. Some newer filters can read images and locate the text in them, but that may inadvertently filter out Non-spam emails that contain images featuring text.
